# Drag and Drog Kanban app

This is a simple yet challenging app that I created for practicing and to add to my portfolio. That app itself is a drag and drop task manager app, where the user is able to create and delete boards, columns, tasks and subtasks. The drag and drop only applies to the tasks although I pretend to implement the to the columns and subtasks. The user also can toggle the subtask that is completed. For this app I decided to use the following stack (NodeJS, Express, PostgreSQL and React).

## Backend (PostgreSQL, NodeJS and Express) 

For database I decided to use PostgreSQL as I already used non-relational database in previews projects and wanted to practice relational database. For the server I use express-validator to validate the user inputs, and implement the login using cookies to store a JSON Web Token.
